Description: Creation of a test laboratory for validation and learning to create a machine learning model for predicting bicycle rental.

1- The workspace environment was created and configured in Azure ML

2- We select the algorithm settings for Randomforest and LightGBM and the other lab settings (https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-fundamentals/Instructions/Labs/01-machine-learning.html)

3- We create and execute the Job.

4- After execution, I created and published the end point and extracted the Json result.

Comments:
With this lab it was possible to learn the following points:
- creation of an automatic machine learning model
- how to submit and parameterize a dataset
- how to determine the target variable
- how to analyze and test results
